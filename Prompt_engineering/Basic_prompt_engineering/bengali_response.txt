Sure! Here is a Bengali poem titled **"Amader Chhoto Nodi"** written in English letters:

**Amader Chhoto Nodi**

Amader chhoto nodi,  
Cholte thake bhorer dike,  
Pakhi gulo geye baji,  
Nodir aloye shokto riike.

Torer dhaare jamuna,  
Joler phool tule ane,  
Chhoto nodir kotha bole,  
Hridaye anando dane.

Shei nodi, raatri bela,  
Chandrer aloy shoja,  
Pakhir gaan, paahari hawar,  
Jurechhe hridoyer moja.

Amader chhoto nodi,  
Cheye thake shobshomoy,  
Nodi chara pran, nirbik,  
Nodi diye ashe joy.

Let me know if you'd like me to write a translation or make it more lyrical!
